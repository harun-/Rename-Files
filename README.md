Rename-Files
============
This is a little program to rename files (such as photos with unintuitive names) to e.g. <new name>_1.jpg, <new name>_2.jpg etc.
Just choose the files you want to rename in the first window. In the second window, type in the <new name> which will all the chosen files will be renamed to, followed by a counting number. The counting number starts at 1.
